# Grocery Store Project
# Summary 
This program was created to track grocery store items purchased in a day, making it easier for the store to see how often each item is bought. The program also creates a histogram to show item frequencies visually and saves the information for later use. 
# What went well
During the creation of this program one part that went really well was adding the input vaidation for the menu options. The program makes sure that users can only choose 1-4, and if they enter soemthing wrong, it asks them to try again. This makes it easier to use and prevents mistakes from causing issues. 
# Enchancements 
I could make the code faster and more efficient when working with large amounts of data. Right now, the program processes items one by one, but using better data structures like hash maps or trees could speed it up. Also, adding checks for the text file would help the program handle missing or incorrect data more smoothly. 
# Most Challenging Code
The hardest part was figuring out how to read from and write to files without errors. I solved this by going over C++ documentation and looking up examples in the reading materials and videos from class. In the future, I will keep learning more about C++, especially file handling data structures. I also had a difficult time navigating the Eclipse ecosystem and the Virtual Lab. To overcome this I called IT as well as watched many YouTube videos. 
# What skills will you use later?
This project helped me get better at handling files, using data structures, and breaking problems into smaller steps. These skills will be useful for any project that deals with data, user input, or file management. I also improved at writing clear, easily maintained code, which is important for future programming. 
Also I now feel much more confident using Eclipse and the virtual lab environment which will be so valuable for future projects. 
# How did you make this program... 
I tried to make the program easy to understand by using clear names for variables and functions. I also added comments in efforts to explain what each part does. That way, if someone else works on the program, they can quickly see how it works.
